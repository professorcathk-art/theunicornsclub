# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Guide - The Unicorns Club

## Why Netlify?
Since Vercel has account-level authentication protection that's blocking your API endpoints, we'll deploy to Netlify which doesn't have this issue.

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy to Netlify

#### Option A: Drag & Drop (Easiest)
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up/login with your GitHub account
3. Drag the `public` folder to the deploy area
4. Your site will be live instantly!

#### Option B: GitHub Integration
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect your GitHub repository: `professorcathk-art/theunicornsclub`
4. Build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build` (or leave empty)
   - Publish directory: `public`
5. Click "Deploy site"

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Click on your site
3. Go to "Site settings" → "Environment variables"
4. Add these variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL` = `postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_K6MBcwQ2HiaV@ep-wandering-recipe-a1umd6r5-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require`
   - `API_SECRET_KEY` = `9d480e7d2afddfad615ef1dd82183aba00c171c9c85729e4103732a4071ec2ec`
   - `NODE_ENV` = `production`

### Step 3: Test Your Deployment

#### Test API Endpoints:
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/hello`
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/submit-main-form`
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/submit-chinese-form`

#### Test Your Forms:
1. Go to your Netlify site URL
2. Fill out the main site form
3. Fill out the Chinese site form
4. Check your Neon database for new leads

## 🔧 Netlify Configuration

The `netlify.toml` file is already configured:
```toml
[build]
  publish = "public"
  command = "npm run build"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
```

## 📊 API Endpoints

### Main Site Form
- **URL:** `/.netlify/functions/submit-main-form`
- **Method:** POST
- **Data:** `{ name, email, role, company }`
- **Saves to:** `main_site_leads` table

### Chinese Site Form
- **URL:** `/.netlify/functions/submit-chinese-form`
- **Method:** POST
- **Data:** `{ name, email, phone }`
- **Saves to:** `chinese_site_leads` table

### Test Endpoint
- **URL:** `/.netlify/functions/hello`
- **Method:** GET
- **Returns:** `{ success: true, message: "Hello from Netlify Functions!" }`

## 🎯 Expected Results

✅ **No authentication protection** (unlike Vercel)
✅ **API endpoints work immediately**
✅ **Forms submit successfully**
✅ **Leads saved to Neon database**
✅ **Custom domain support**
✅ **Automatic HTTPS**

## 🔗 Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to "Domain settings" in Netlify dashboard
2. Add your custom domain
3. Update DNS records as instructed
4. Your site will be available on your custom domain

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If API endpoints return 404:
1. Check that `netlify/functions/` folder exists
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check Netlify function logs in dashboard

### If forms don't submit:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoints are accessible
3. Check Netlify function logs

### If database connection fails:
1. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct
2. Check Neon database is accessible
3. Check Netlify function logs
